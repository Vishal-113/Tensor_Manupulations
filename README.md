# TensorFlow Assignments: Tensors, Loss Functions & TensorBoard

This notebook demonstrates three key concepts in TensorFlow: tensor manipulation, loss function behavior, and training visualization with TensorBoard.

## 1. Tensor Manipulations & Reshaping

**Goal:** Learn how to create, reshape, and manipulate tensors using TensorFlow.

### Steps:
1. **Create a tensor** with shape `(4, 6)` filled with random values.
2. **Inspect the tensor**:
   - **Rank** is the number of dimensions (e.g., 2 for a matrix).
   - **Shape** gives the size along each axis.
3. **Reshape the tensor** to shape `(2, 3, 4)` to convert it into a 3D tensor.
4. **Transpose it** to shape `(3, 2, 4)` by reordering the axes.
5. **Broadcasting**:
   - A small tensor of shape `(1, 4)` is added to the larger tensor.
   - TensorFlow automatically expands dimensions to allow element-wise operations.

**Broadcasting Explanation:**
TensorFlow uses broadcasting to perform element-wise operations between tensors of different shapes by automatically expanding the smaller tensor without copying data.

## 2. Loss Functions & Hyperparameter Tuning

**Goal:** Understand and compare different loss functions by evaluating prediction changes.

### Steps:
1. Define **true labels** (`y_true`) and **model predictions** (`y_pred`).
2. Calculate:
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures average squared difference between predictions and true values.
   - **Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE)**: Used for classification, measures the difference between true labels and predicted probabilities.
3. Slightly change the predictions and observe how the loss values respond.
4. Plot the results using **Matplotlib** to compare the loss values across predictions.

## 3. Train a Neural Network and Log to TensorBoard

**Goal:** Train a neural network on MNIST and visualize training metrics with TensorBoard.

### Steps:
1. **Load and preprocess MNIST dataset**:
   - Normalize image pixel values to range `[0, 1]`.
2. **Define a simple neural network**:
   - Flatten layer, one hidden dense layer with ReLU, dropout for regularization, and output softmax layer.
3. **Train the model for 5 epochs** and enable TensorBoard logging using `TensorBoard` callback.
4. **View logs in TensorBoard**:
   - Launch with: `tensorboard --logdir=logs/fit`
   - Observe trends in **training and validation accuracy/loss**.

## TensorBoard Insights

1. **Training vs. Validation Accuracy**:
   - Training accuracy typically increases.
   - Validation accuracy may plateau or decrease (overfitting).

2. **Detecting Overfitting**:
   - If training accuracy continues rising but validation accuracy falls, the model is likely overfitting.

3. **Effect of More Epochs**:
   - May improve training accuracy but risk overfitting.
   - TensorBoard helps visualize when to stop training.

This notebook is useful for learning how TensorFlow handles tensors, evaluates model accuracy using different loss functions, and enables debugging and optimization via TensorBoard.
